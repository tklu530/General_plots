# General: a 3D field propagator for partial illuminance onto arbitrary nanostructures of total lateral dimensions up to millimeters. It is designed for metalenses, gratings, diffractive lenses and others structures designed with planar technology.
# author: Tobias Lange

# This repository holds a few examples and the corresponding graphical outputs of General.
# The presented structures are: metalens, diffractive lens, metalens system, 2D gold grating, optical disk (CD)
